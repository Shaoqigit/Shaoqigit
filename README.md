### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to Shaoqi's git

Feel free to browse my space and leave your stars, comments, PR, issues :smirk:

I am currently working on commercial FEM software development and some personal fun projects on sound simulation.

Personal interest is on Finite Element Method, Model Order Reduction (MOR) and relevant numerical methods for science.
